# LedD
LEDD Daemon in Python3

## What is LedD?

LedD is a daemon for interfacing LED stripes. It provides an abstract interface for effects to control any kind of LED stripe through an adapter (a driver). An Android application can connect and natively change any settings for the effects.

## Goals

- manage multiple stripes and controllers at the same time
- an open effects github repository with simple download-and-run system
- automatic enumeration of the connected controller devices, restart/reset and status querys
